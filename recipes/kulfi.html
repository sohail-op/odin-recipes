    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Kulfi is a popular Indian dessert made with condensed milk, cream, and a
      variety of flavorings. It is often described as a denser and creamier
      version of ice cream, with a texture that is smooth and creamy but not
      quite as soft as traditional ice cream. Kulfi is traditionally made in
      small, cone- or barrel-shaped molds and is served in slices or as
      popsicles. It is a popular dessert in many parts of India, particularly
      during the hot summer months, and is enjoyed by people of all ages. Some
      popular flavors of kulfi include mango, pistachio, and cardamom.
