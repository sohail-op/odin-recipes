    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Try this recipe if you want to know how to make traditional Indian gajar
      ka halwa, or carrot halwa. A lovely dessert anytime, I most recently made
      it for Diwali. This is the 'old school' method that uses whole milk, not
      condensed milk. You can use ghee instead of oil for initially cooking the
      carrots, if desired.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons sunflower seed oil</li>
      <li>2 pounds carrots, grated</li>
      <li>1 ½ quarts whole milk</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup raisins</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons ground cardamom</li>
      <li>1 pinch saffron threads</li>
      <li>8 tablespoons chopped pistachio nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat and add carrots. Cook and
        stir briefly, about 3 minutes. Pour in milk and increase heat; bring to
        a boil and cook, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low
        and simmer gently, uncovered, for 1 hour.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Bring carrot-milk mixture back to a boil. Add sugar, raisins, cardamom,
        and saffron. Cook and stir until mixture has thickened, about 10
        minutes.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>
        Ladle carrot halwa into 8 individual serving dishes. Top each serving
        with 1 tablespoon pistachios. Serve warm or chill before serving.
